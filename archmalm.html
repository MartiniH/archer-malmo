	<title>Archer Malmo Visit</title>

Friday of last week I took a trip to Archer-Malmo, a PR agency working out of the beautiful Memphis Cotton Exchange. They packed all the kids into three golden elevators, which I thought would break and kill us. As soon as I got off the elevator I petted a dog, which was pretty good. There was a comfortable L shaped couch that I settled into and watched the wonderful presentation put on by four guys with beards, I wondered what their chins looked like. The organization of company operations appealed to me, the lax management allowed employees to flourish in creativity and efficiency, I wanted to ask some detailed questions to the manager, but I couldn't find a spot where I could get my word in.
